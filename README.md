# Learn You A `bash`

This series of modules is designed for users new to the Unix shell environment. If you are a new user of Linux, or a Mac user just starting to explore what can be done with that Terminal application in your Utilities folder, this one is for you.

## How To Use These Modules

Currently, you're reading the top-level README.md, formatted using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you're not already, please view it in a Markdown-compatible viewer -- viewing this repository on the Github website with your browser will do the job.

In this directory (you may be accustomed to calling directories _folders_, especially if you are a user of Macs, but in this guide we will use _directories_ to mean the same thing) you will find a number of subdirectories, in numerical order. As a new user, you'll do best if you move through these directories in order. Each one contains a README.md, which you can view by opening it in the Github repository using your browser. Definitely don't skip `000_intro`, as it includes the instructions for actually finding and starting `bash`, as well as some conventions for how to read this guide.

The first several modules will have only a README.md, and you will work through the corresponding exercises by opening a terminal on your computer, then running some commands by typing them in the terminal and pressing Enter.

Later modules will explore bash's capabilities as a programming tool, and we will write what's called _shell scripts_ to run simple programs directly in the terminal. If you are not familiar with other programming languages, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND learning some other language before starting to work with these modules. The bash scripting language builds on the fundamentals we will learn in the earlier lessons, but it is a notoriously arcane tool and you will have a much easier time if you come with some programming fundamentals already under your belt. 

Try my [Learn You A Python](https://www.github.com/vellichor/learn_you_a_python) guide if you are ready to learn your first programming language! This guide assumes that you can already navigate your terminal, though, so my recommendation is that you first work through the 0-series modules in this guide. Then go get your Python on, and then come back here for shell scripting time!
